Hey there! My name is Chandra Irugalbandara, and I'm thrilled to meet you. I'm a graduate of the University of Moratuwa, and I'm currently working as a Senior Machine Learning Engineer in the CoreAI Team at Jaseci Labs. We're working on creating the world's first neurosymbolic programming language, which is super exciting!

In my free time, I love to play Scrabble and Chess, and I'm always up for a friendly game. I'm also an avid baker and cook, and I love experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen.
