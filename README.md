I am Chandra Irugalbandara. Currently, I am an Electrical Engineering undergraduate at the University of Moratuwa. Other than coding, I like to cook (mainly baking).

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on MoraGPA App & Career Fair Platform
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning GraphQL, Firebase & Software Engineering Principles
- âš¡ Fun fact: listening to Opera Music while being drunk is the bomb!
