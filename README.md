I am Chandra Irugalbandara. Currently, I am an Electrical Engineering undergraduate at the University of Moratuwa. Other than coding, I like to cook (mainly baking).

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Unimate, HomeIO, YoloR Inference Engine
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Software Engineering Architectural Design
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on ML related services
- ⚡ Fun fact: listening to Opera Music while drinking 🍺 is the bomb!
